Beautiful is better than ugly.
美比丑好
Explicit is better than implicit.
明比涩强
Simple is better than complex.
简胜于繁
Complex is better than complicated.
复杂的比难懂的要好
Flat is better than nested.
平的比嵌套的要好
Sparse is better than dense.
宜疏莫密
编程说的是不要想着用一行代码实现过多的功能，多些写几行没关系，看的清楚，易于理解

Readability counts.
可读性很重要
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
特殊情况没有比打破规则更特殊,尽管实用性胜过纯粹
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
错误从来不会安静的过去，除非明确的让其安静。
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
直面不明确，拒绝猜的诱惑
不明其理，追根问底。
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
用一种方法，最好是唯一的一种，明显的方法来做
尽管一开始，这个方法不明显，除非你是Dutch
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
立足当下，行必有方

现在开始做，比永远都不做强。但永远都不做，比想起来就干，不准备、不思考、没方向的蛮干、胡干要强。


If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
如果实现很难解释，这是个不好的点子，
如果实现很容易解释，这是一个好的点子
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
名正易识，善莫大焉
